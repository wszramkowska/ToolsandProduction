## Project Outline (Suggested Word Count 500)
- Provide a concise description of the project, including its core concept and purpose.  
- Outline the initial goals or objectives you aim to achieve.  
- Identify any anticipated challenges or potential issues that may arise during development.  

This project is a physics-based puzzle game in which players control a robot suit with a detachable bubble head. Spread across four levels, the game introduces players to various environmental challenges that interact with and change the properties of the bubble. The changing states of the bubble make up the core gameplay behaviour, allowing for unique and evolving puzzle mechanics throughout the game.

Although I will be helping with general programming throughout the project, my main focus will be as an audio programmer. I want to create a responsive, high-quality sound experience that support's the games tones and mechanics.

- Discuss challenges you faced, whether technical, creative, or time-related, and evaluate their impact on the final product.  
- Reflect on any mistakes or missteps and what you learned from them.  

### Next Time
- Outline what you would do differently if you were to undertake a similar project again.  
- Suggest improvements to your workflow, research methods, or implementation process based on your reflections.  
- Consider any new tools, techniques, or approaches you would explore in future projects to achieve better results.  

## Bibliography
- Compile a complete list of all sources referenced throughout your project. This may include articles, journals, videos, games, software, documentation, or any other materials.  
- Ensure all references are formatted according to the university's citation method.  
- Organise your references in alphabetical order. Alternatively, you may separate them by type (e.g., academic sources, games, videos), but consistency is key.  

## Declared Assets
